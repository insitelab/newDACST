# newDACST
This repo has a new adaptation of the original protocol for the Draw a Computer Scientist Test (Martin, 2004). This included a template for an online data collection form and instructions for a database backend to collect and analyze the selected response, text open response, and image data. It is easiest to administer this in the beginning of the first day of class and a week before the end of the semester if using a pre/post format.

The file descriptions follow:

Draw a Computer Scientist Test - Template
This is a printed Google Form contains an example study consent script, a demographics section, the image section with description prompt, and a set of additional open response questions taken from the standard Martin (2004) protocol. This can be used as an online form (Google Form, MS form, etc.) for DACST data collection. Use with the DACST Image Box.

The students are sked to draw their image, take photo of the image, and upload it using the online form (see above).
