# newDACST
This repo has a new adaptation of the original protocol for the Draw a Computer Scientist Test (Martin, 2004). This included a template for an online data collection form and instructions for a database backend to collect and analyze the selected response, text open response, and image data. It is easiest to administer this in the beginning of the first day of class and a week before the end of the semester if using a pre/post format.

The file descriptions follow:

For Data Collection:

Draw a Computer Scientist Test - Template

This is a printed Google Form contains an example study consent script, a demographics section, the image section with description prompt, and a set of additional open response questions taken from the standard Martin (2004) protocol. This can be used as an online form (Google Form, MS form, etc.) for DACST data collection. Use with the DACST Image Box.

DACST Image Box - Template

The students are asked to draw their image, take photo of the image, and upload it using the online form (see above).


For Data Coding and Analysis:

Image Coding Instructions - 

This document provides a general set of instructions for coding the images for analysis. See ITiCSE 2024 paper for more detail on the methods for inter-rater reliability on the paired coding of images.

DACST Image Coding Template - 

This spreadsheet provides a template for the coding of images. Each coding assistant codes a set of images and their paired coding assistant codes the same set of images.

For Image and Text Data Storage:
